# Specification Quality Checklist: Namespace/Repository Deletion Ordering and System Repository Bootstrap

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass on first validation pass. The one ambiguous point in the original
  request — whether cross-namespace reference rejection for catalog resource fields
  is in scope — was resolved by direct codebase verification (confirmed unimplemented
  anywhere) rather than a [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker, and is documented as an
  explicit scope exclusion in the spec's Assumptions section.
- Ready for `/speckit.plan`.
